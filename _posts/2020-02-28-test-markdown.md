Hello! My name is Sisi. I was born in Shanghai but immigrated to the States with my beloved little brother, a miniature poodle, and mother. I earned my Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Econometrics from NYU Stern School of Business, and Master of Science in Financial Engineering from UCLA Anderson School of Business. I developed my interest in Biostatistics ever since my little brother was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. So, intead of pursuing a PhD in Finance, I decided to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics with main research focusing on biomarkers for early cancer detection at UCLA. 
#This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown]
#(https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
