Hello! My name is Sisi. I was born in Shanghai but immigrated to the States with my beloved little brother, a miniature poodle, and mother. I earned my Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Econometrics from NYU Stern School of Business, and Master of Science in Financial Engineering from UCLA Anderson School of Business. I developed my interest in Biostatistics ever since my little brother was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. So, instead of pursuing a PhD in Finance, I decided to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics with main research focusing on biomarkers for early cancer detection at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.
